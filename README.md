I make the Todo App with the use of Reducer. It is very usefull and I add some functionality in this. 
You can Add you Todo list in this and If you completed the task so you can simply click the completed button which is on the left side. 
After Clicking this button you can see that your task is done and The text will be striked. 
There is a delete button after completing the task you can delete the item.
